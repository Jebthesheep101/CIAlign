### Results of time and memory measurements

Time and memory has been measured for the cleaning functions and the mini alignments using the functions in /extra_scripts/checkMemoryAndTime.py on a number of randomly selected MSAs from the HomFam benchmarking set (Ref 1).
Furthermore, the effect of gap content on time and memory has been measured on MSAs of constant size with different gap proportions.
